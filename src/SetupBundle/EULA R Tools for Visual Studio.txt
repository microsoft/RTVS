   * updates,
   * supplements,

   * support services
for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms apply. 
BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE. 
AS DESCRIBED BELOW, USING THE SOFTWARE ALSO OPERATES AS YOUR CONSENT TO THE TRANSMISSION OF CERTAIN COMPUTER INFORMATION DURING ACTIVATION, VALIDATION AND USE OF INTERNET-BASED SERVICES. 
IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW.
1. PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE.  This software is a pre-release version.  It may not operate correctly or work the way a final version of the software will.  Microsoft may change it for the final, commercial version.  We also may not release a commercial version. Microsoft is not obligated to provide maintenance, technical support or updates to you for the software.  
2. INSTALLATION, USE RIGHTS AND RESTRICTIONS. You may install and use copies of the software as follows:
   a. INTERNAL PRODUCTION USE.  If you comply with the rest of these license terms, you may use the software to design, develop, test and demonstrate your programs in a live production environment for your internal use, provided that:
      i. you take adequate precautionary measures to back up and protect your data; 
      ii. you agree to cease such use immediately upon notice from Microsoft; and 
      iii. such production environment may only be accessible by your employees and contractors, except as permitted below.

      ii. you will not make any representation, warranty or promise on behalf of Microsoft or with respect to the software or its performance.
          This right to deploy your programs for external access by third parties does not include the right to deploy programs that are designed for the purpose of hosting other third party software applications.

   a. FONT COMPONENTS.  While the software is running, you may use its fonts to display and print content. You may only
      * embed fonts in content as permitted by the embedding restrictions in the fonts; and
      * temporarily download them to a printer or other output device to help print content.
4. DATA. 
   a. CONSENT FOR INTERNET-BASED SERVICES. Microsoft provides Internet-based services with the software. It may change or cancel them at any time. The software features described below and in the Visual Studio 2013 privacy statement connect to Microsoft or service provider computer systems over the Internet. In some cases, you will not receive a separate notice when they connect. You may switch off these features or not use them. For more information about these features, see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=286720. BY USING THESE FEATURES, YOU CONSENT TO THE TRANSMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION. Microsoft does not use the information to identify or contact you.
      MISUSE OF INTERNET-BASED SERVICES. You may not use these services in any way that could harm them or impair anyone else’s use of them.  You may not use the services to try to gain unauthorized access to any service, data, account or network by any means.
   b. COMPUTER INFORMATION.  The following features use Internet protocols, which send to the appropriate systems computer information, such as your Internet protocol address, the type of operating system, browser and name and version of the software you are using, and the language code of the device where you installed the software. Microsoft uses this information to make the Internet-based services available to you.
      * VISUAL STUDIO EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM. This software uses the Visual Studio Experience Improvement Program (“VSEIP”) which is on by default.  VSEIP helps Microsoft collect information about problems that you have while using the software. Microsoft also uses VSEIP Information to improve its software and services.  Microsoft may also share VSEIP data with others, such as agents acting on Microsoft’s behalf and hardware and software vendors to improve how their products run with Microsoft software. To learn more about VSEIP, including how you can opt out, see go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=286720.
      * DATA COLLECTED AUTOMATICALLY. Microsoft automatically collects information identifying your installed Microsoft product, the operating system of the device, the CPU architecture of the operating system and data regarding the success or failure of the installation of the software, data identifying the cause of a crash in the product and information about the product license which is in use.  Microsoft does not use this information to identify or contact you.  For more information about privacy, see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=286720.
   c. MICROSOFT ACCOUNTS IN VISUAL STUDIO.  If you are running the software on Windows 8, Windows 7 with sign-in assistant, or any other version of Windows that supports providing a Microsoft account directly to the software and you are signed into a Microsoft account in those versions of Windows, you may automatically be signed into the software and Visual Studio services accessed by the software using the same Microsoft account. This allows you to access services within the software and roam the software’s settings without being asked to reenter your Microsoft account credentials each time you start the software. For more information about signing into the software and the services available therein with a Microsoft account, see the privacy statement http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=286720.
   d. USE OF INFORMATION. Microsoft may use the computer and services information to improve its software and services. Microsoft may also share it with others, such as hardware and software vendors. They may use the information to improve how their products run with Microsoft software.
